/**
 * Returns a recommendation object containing a list of items to recommend to the customer.
 *
 * `getRecommendation()` determines which items to recommend based on the given recommendation algorithms.
 *
 * `getRecommendation()` doesn’t run the algorithms. It calls the installed apps that provide them.
 *
 * Apps may provide algorithms for use with their own catalogs, or for use with catalogs from other apps.
 * For example, Wix Stores provides algorithms that can only be used on its own catalogs.
 * To run an algorithm, the app providing it must be installed, and an app providing a supported catalog must be installed.
 * For more information and to see which algorithms are available on your site or project, call [`listAvailableAlgorithms()`](#listavailablealgorithms).
 *
 * `getRecommendation()` operates as follows:
 * 1. `getRecommendation()` receives as input a list of algorithms as an array. These algorithms can be provided by different apps and can apply to different catalogs.
 * 2. `getRecommendation()` calls the app that corresponds to the `appId` of the first algorithm in the list of algorithms. It passes that algorithm’s ID and the IDs of any subsequent algorithms in the array for the same app.
 * 3. The app runs the algorithms.
 * 4. `getRecommendation()` returns items recommendations from the first algorithm (according to its position in the `algorithms` array) that meets the minimum number of recommendations. At that point `getRecommendation()` stops calling other apps.
 * 5. If none of the algorithms run by the first app meet the minimum recommended items, `getRecommendation()` finds the next algorithm in the array with a new `appId` (an ID of an app that has not yet been called), and repeats the process.
 * 6. If no algorithms in the `algorithms` array recommend at least the minimum recommended items, `getRecommendation()` returns an empty array.
